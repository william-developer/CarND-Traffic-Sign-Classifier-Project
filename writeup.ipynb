    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decide to convert the images to grayscale because the precondition of the grayscal is that the traffic sign is irrelevant to the color. More importantly, there is only one channel in the gray scale, which improves model to reduce the amount of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I use ImageDataGenerator to generate additional data because over-fitting. More data should be improve the situation. As the same time, it costs much time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalize the image data because it can improve the speed of convergence and the numerical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I use an Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001 which is appropriate value. Large learning rate will not find the best value while little learning brings slow training. The batch size is set to 128. Larger batch size costs much time and memory. The dropout is 0.5,which improves over-fitting. The number of epochs is 100. Actually, the model converges about after 89 epochs. Model need more epochs because of generated additional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "I choose the LeNet to classify the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "LeNet is simple and it works well on the Minist dataset and it is also a multi-classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?  \n",
    "The final model's accuracy the training, validation and test set are similar. It works well. If the training accuracy is much larger than the validation and test accuracy, it is over-fitting. If all the accuracy are small, it is under-fitting. we can add dropout and regularizer for the over-fitting while we can add more fully connected layers for the under-fitting.\n",
